# Task 04: Deploy Procedure Review - Blocked

## Summary
The task "デプロイ手順レビュー（実行なし）" (260202_2135_from_Codex_04_deploy_review.md) was received, but the review could not be completed.

## Blocking Issue
The target file for the review, docs/deploy.md, is currently listed in the project's .gitignore file. As a result, I am unable to access and read the contents of the file.

## Next Steps
The review of the deployment procedures will be initiated as soon as access to docs/deploy.md is granted (i.e., by removing the deploy.md entry from .gitignore).

This report is to inform you of the current blocker. I will await further instructions or a change in the repository's ignore settings.
