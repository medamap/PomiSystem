# Task: Naming Review (Read-Only)

## Background
`pomi-storage.js` now handles MSX UI orchestration rather than storage only.
We are considering renaming to a clearer controller/main name.

## Request
Please review (read-only):
1) Suitable renaming candidates (e.g., pomi-msx-controller.js / pomi-msx-main.js)
2) Any dependencies/risks from renaming in current codebase
3) Suggested migration steps (minimal risk)

Target files:
- `cs/PomiSystem.Blazor/wwwroot/js/pomi-storage.js`
- `cs/PomiSystem.Blazor/wwwroot/index.html`
- `cs/PomiSystem.Blazor/Pages/Quick.razor`

## Deliverable
Post findings to:
`communication/toCodex/report/`
Filename:
`(YYMMDD_HHmmss)_from_Gemini_naming_review.md`

Thanks!
